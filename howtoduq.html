            <h3>How to become a better programmer</h3>
            <p>The first step to becoming a better programmer is to let go of everything you think you know about programming.

                It’s a lie.
                
                The most important skill for a programmer is not knowing how to write code. It’s knowing where to find out how to write code. And that’s why the best programmers are also the best learners, the very best of which are also the best teachers. Because the thing about learning is that no matter who you are, there’s always something new to learn and someone has figured it out and they want to tell you all about it and they really want you to know this stuff so they wrote an article or a blog post or a book or an essay or whatever, and now it exists in your world forever, whether you ever read it or not, because once something is written down it will be written down forever more because nothing ever disappears on the Internet. The nice thing about learning from other people because if someone tells you something then they don’t have any reason not to tell you everything else too so if someone tells me one thing then I can just ask them what else do I need to know? And over time I can figure out what all there is that I need to know in order for me not only survive but thrive in this profession. And sometimes what I learned from one person doesn’t fit into my life until later when someone else teaches me another piece of knowledge that makes those two things connect inside my head in some way that lets me see how they complement each other even though at first glance they seem unrelated. But sometimes I learn too much too fast and suddenly several months later I look up from my work as if coming out of a trance at work and realize oh wait there was this whole huge world outside the office building but now I don’t remember any of it except for maybe some details about some programming language and maybe the name of a famous programmer I read about somewhere which means that it’s time to go back to school again to learn more stuff and fill in my gaps. Because there’s no way I could ever learn everything at once, even if someone could tell me everything they know in one day. <br>
                
                I mean, come on, did you really think it was possible for any human being to know everything there is to know about programming? That’s ridiculous. And yet there are people who make claims like that all the time. They call themselves experts, but they don’t understand that our profession is never static because no matter how much you learn today you will have learned something new tomorrow and so next week what do you know? You were an expert last week but now it turns out you were wrong about something or someone else has taught you something new which changes your perspective into a slightly different kind of expert entirely. <br>
                
                Anyway, suffice it to say that learning is essential for the survival of any programmer. If a programmer stops learning then their career will stall out because eventually everyone else will catch up with them and then they’ll be left behind and obsolete because being obsolete is what happens when we stop learning which means we die out as programmers just like real-world organisms die out when they stop evolving by changing into something different before everyone else does so as not to become extinct. But if we keep on learning then we can keep adding new things into our lives until eventually we realize that there are so many tools available in our toolbox today that it would literally take us several lifetimes just to use all the new things we learn every year without ever actually writing any code except maybe one little line here or there just for testing purposes only not actually compiling anything because who cares if your program compiles when it’s just a test anyway? <br>
                
                I mean, come on. Do you really think that I could compile all the programs in my toolbox one after another with no interruptions until I eventually die from exhaustion? That would be ridiculous. And yet people do this kind of thing all the time by trying to learn everything about programming as fast as possible and then getting frustrated when they don’t get results in an amount of time that is less than the length of their own life expectancy which always strikes me as very rude and inconsiderate because it’s like these people are trying to cram their whole lives worth of learning into a single lifetime instead of spreading it out over several lifetimes so that they have multiple chances to succeed at learning everything they want to learn without having to wait around for several decades before they can move on or else just give up entirely because 70 years isn’t enough time to learn everything you need to know so what good is this career even if your company pays you a lot because eventually your company will go out of business and then what do you do? <br>
                
                So anyway, back to our story: the second step in becoming better programmers is simply knowing how to find out how to program. And that’s why knowing how to search is more important than knowing how to code anything in particular. Because the point of the profession is not to write code, it’s to learn new things and then figure out what all there is you can do with it once you know how to do it. And that’s why I insist on always paying attention when someone says “Oh, did you know about this?” because often times they are taking me down a path that I never would have known about otherwise and now suddenly there are all these rules and patterns and tools lying around for me to use for my own purposes whenever I want them because this person has already learned those things for me and now they have decided that I should know too so they went ahead and wrote an article or a blog post or a book or an essay or whatever which means that if I take time out of my life to read everything ever written about programming then eventually I will become powerful beyond imagination as far as programming goes which means eventually I will also be able to program at superhuman speeds — like superhuman speeds compared with the speed of ordinary people who don’t bother learning anything new — but only if I am willing to spend most of my life just reading instead of writing programs at all which means most people won’t consider this profession worthwhile even though learning is really what makes our profession valuable in the first place which means we need more people who take advantage of our profession by paying attention while everyone else talks so they can discover all the knowledge that everyone else has already discovered before them so we don’t have repeat ourselves over and over again every time we encounter some new technology or tool because sometimes someone else has already figured out exactly how something works even if no one has ever explained it clearly enough for us before.</p>

            <h3>How to bake brownies</h3>
            <p>The first step in baking a perfect batch of brownies is to gather the ingredients. You need to have 3 eggs, 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 cup of sugar and the spices you want your brownies to have (ground cinnamon, ground cloves).
<br>
                Step 2: Prepare the brownie pan very well
<br>
                To make your brownies look perfect when they are done, it is important that you prepare your brownie pan very well. Soak it in hot water for about 10 minutes then wipe it dry before you put in any batter into it. This will ensure that all your brownies come out clean and neat.
                <br>
                Step 3: Prepare the batter and pour them into the pan evenly
                <br>
                After preparing your brownie pan and gathering all ingredients, you can now start making your batter by mixing all ingredients except chocolate chips in a bowl until they are well blended. Once they are thoroughly mixed together, you can slowly add chocolate chips until they are fully coated with the mixture. Then using a spoon or spatula spread the mixture evenly around in each corner of the prepared pan so that when baked there will be no separation of batter or uneven distribution of chocolate chips throughout each square of fudge brownie.
                <br>
                Step 4: Bake the brownies in a preheated oven
                <br>
                The best way to bake your brownies is to use an electric oven with a preheated temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Set the time for 30 minutes and check if they are ready by inserting a toothpick or fork into the center of each square. If they come out clean, then your brownies are done.
                <br>
                Step 5: Cool the brownies before eating them
                <br>
                After removing them from the pan, you can allow them to cool down before taking a bite out of these delicious fudge brownie squares. It is important that you do not eat warm brownies because they will be sticky and difficult to cut through. And remember, let people know that if you want all your brownies to be perfect it is very important that you follow every step mentioned above very carefully and precisely as described so that all your effort will not go to waste once they are baked. Good luck!</p>
